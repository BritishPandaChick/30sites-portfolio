            <h2>A Note from <span>Rapunzel</span></h2>
            <p>During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants
              were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest,
              and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine,
              by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. Lady
              Catherine de Bourgh’s attention to his wishes, and consideration for
              his comfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen
              better. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise.</p>

              <p>The subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner,
              and with a most important aspect he protested that “he had never in
              his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank--such affability
              and condescension, as he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to
              approve of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour
              of preaching before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings,
              and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool
              of quadrille in the evening.</p>
